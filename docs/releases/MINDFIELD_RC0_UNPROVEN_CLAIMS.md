# Mindfield RC-0 · Unproven Claims Register

These claims **must NOT be treated as proven** at RC-0. Each one is the kind of thing that
sounds true from the architecture, sounds true from the green test count, sounds true from
the smoke output — and is not true until a human cycle confirms it.

Each entry: claim · evidence currently available · evidence missing · minimal playtest
observation that would change the verdict.

## C1 — The games form psychotechnical functions in a human

**Claim:** after playing one of the 12 жанров, the player can perform an operation in the
world that they could not perform before, and they can do it WITHOUT the app.

**Evidence available:**
- per-genre real seeds carry the expected play shape (4 real LLM organ verdicts;
  4 absence types; 4 sorting zones; 4 false-consensus zones; etc.);
- automated tests confirm the cycle produces a qualitative profile dimension matching
  the canonical name (e.g. `false_click_bias: pseudo_depth` on the False Click real seed).

**Evidence missing:**
- any observation of a player using the operation OUTSIDE the app within ≥24 hours of
  the session;
- any observation that the player can NAME the operation without referencing the game
  vocabulary;
- any observation that the operation survives in a different context (different text /
  different medium / different topic).

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> 24h–48h after playing False Click on the real seed, the player is shown an unrelated
> LLM answer and asked: "what kind of fail does this have? what's the operation?". They
> must name the bias type without prompting from the observer and without re-reading
> their .md export.

## C2 — Transfer outside the app

**Claim:** the trained operation transfers to a substrate the game did not stage —
voice, group meeting, document review, code review, conversation.

**Evidence available:**
- the medium_shift_phrase field and the Ontology Customs porода explicitly stage
  transfer as the gameplay verb;
- the test `test_block3::test_ontology_customs_full_flow` asserts the trace records
  a transfer move with `preserves_action=True`.

**Evidence missing:**
- any observation that operations trained in False Click (clickable text)
  carry into Register Sapper (medium variants), and from there into actual chat
  or meeting practice;
- any observation that the player initiates the operation unprompted.

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> Within one week of completing the full cycle, the observer asks: "tell me one
> situation in this week where you noticed what you trained, without us prompting
> you." A YES requires the player to name the SITUATION, the OPERATION, and what they
> would have done before. NO answer or vague answer = transfer unproven.

## C3 — Replay improves the player, not only mutates text

**Claim:** the second session, played on a mutated material, EXERCISES the weakness named
by the directive — and the player's profile on the second session reflects movement on the
named axis.

**Evidence available:**
- `material_mutator` returns a structurally valid new material with the same field_type
  schema as the parent (all 12 жанров);
- the new material's `mutation_directive` is persisted alongside `parent_id` for trace.

**Evidence missing:**
- no test asserts that the CONTENT of the new material amplifies the directive's named
  axis (e.g. "more pseudo-depth phrases that imply more than they commit to");
- no observation that the player's second-round profile DIFFERS from the first round in
  the direction the directive predicted (e.g. `operation_proof_strength` shifts from
  `weak` to `medium`).

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> Player plays a real seed of any жанр. After completion they read the directive and
> the observer asks them to predict, in one sentence, what the next material will do
> differently. The player plays the mutated material. The observer compares (a) the
> player's prediction to (b) the actual new material content and (c) the new profile.
> The cycle counts as proving C3 only if (a)≈(b) AND the new profile shows movement
> on the axis named in (a).

## C4 — Generated draft genomes are playable on humans

**Claim:** drafts produced by `chimera_weaver` from any of the 40 chimera cells can be
opened in the configurator and the playability verdict reflects what a human player would
say.

**Evidence available:**
- `test_block4_chimera::test_chimera_draft_runs_through_weaver` confirms that the
  chimera-generated draft passes `playability_critic = playable` when sufficient banks
  are populated;
- live smoke (`smoke_chimera.py`) produced a draft `Сминёр` for `Смысловой клик × Антислоп`
  with a credible function and verb.

**Evidence missing:**
- the configurator does not yet expose a "promote draft to runtime genome" path —
  the design loop ends at `playable` verdict, not at a playable session;
- no human has attempted to TURN a chimera-generated draft INTO a session and play it;
- the LLM-named organs in the draft are not validated against the canonical bank's
  intent — only their existence in the bank is checked.

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> A designer-player picks one chimera cell, generates a draft, opens it in the
> configurator, and answers (without help): "could I run a 30-minute session from
> this draft right now?" — naming material type, the bearing move, and one expected
> failure mode. If they can answer all three, C4 has first evidence.

## C5 — Triage fate quality at scale

**Claim:** the 9 §4 fates remain meaningful as the player works through 4 200 cards.
A fate assignment in card #2 014 is as load-bearing as one in card #14.

**Evidence available:**
- per-card automated test of the fate API surface;
- the fate menu is canonical (matches §4 of the spec);
- triage UI is the same for every card.

**Evidence missing:**
- no observation that fate distribution stabilizes after a meaningful number of cards
  (does the player just spam `keep_seed` after 100 cards?);
- no observation that the EXTRACTED organs from triage end up actually USED in
  configurator drafts (i.e. that organ extraction is connected to design action and
  not just to bank growth).

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> One playtester triages 50 cards in one sitting. The observer records:
> · fate distribution per 10-card window — does the player keep using the full menu,
>   or does it collapse to 1-2 fates after the first 20 cards?
> · how many of the cards triaged as `extract_organ` lead to an actual organ being
>   selected by the same player in a configurator draft within the same session?

## C6 — Live LLM role stability over long sessions

**Claim:** the four organ roles (`prosecutor`, `spackler`, `sprout_advocate`,
`literal_alien`) hold their role contract across many turns within one session and
across many sessions on the same player.

**Evidence available:**
- `test_phase2::test_llm_roles_remain_non_assistant` (mock provider only — deterministic);
- `smoke_user_phrase.py` shows a single-turn prosecutor on `gpt-4.1-mini` and `grok-4-0709`
  producing in-language attacks that quote the player's claim;
- Phase 3A gauntlet doc records that `grok-4-0709` outperforms `gpt-4.1-mini` for
  `literal_alien` over a small N.

**Evidence missing:**
- no automated test of role behavior under live LLM;
- no observation of role behavior under >5 interventions in the same session;
- no observation of role drift across model versions over weeks.

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> One playtester runs a 25-turn session in False Click, each turn pressing the
> prosecutor again on different units. Observer records:
> · does the attack stop quoting the player's text after turn N?
> · does the probe_question ever turn into a coaching question?
> · does the JSON contract ever break?

## C7 — Usefulness of cross-game Operator Profile

**Claim:** the `/operator` page's named cross-pattern callouts (e.g. "глубина-форма по
обоим контурам: вход — pseudo-depth, выход — сохранение dead beauty") tell the player
something they did not already know, and they can act on it.

**Evidence available:**
- the aggregator produces structured per-game dimensions and named patterns when
  prerequisite games are played;
- the pattern list is hand-written, not statistical (avoiding the worst Barnum failure).

**Evidence missing:**
- no observation that a player who has played 2+ games READS the cross-pattern panel;
- no observation that the player CONFIRMS the pattern when shown it;
- no observation that the player NAMES a behavior outside the app that the pattern
  predicts.

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> Two games played on real seeds. Observer asks: "before you look at the page, what
> do you think your profile says about how you read?" Then opens `/operator`.
> Player reads. Observer asks: "anything correct? anything wrong? anything new?"
> Score is qualitative — the page passes if at least one named pattern lands as
> "correct AND new".

## C8 — Players understand what action they are performing

**Claim:** at every step of every game, the player can NAME the action they are
performing in their own words, without referring to the genome.

**Evidence available:**
- field renderers were patched (Phase 14 from playtest screenshots) to add verbose
  explanations of what `bearing_node` / `weak_sprout` / `false_click` / `service_phrase`
  mean as defenses;
- TracePanel labels each action with a "what this changed" sentence;
- LLMPanel labels the organ as "NOT an assistant".

**Evidence missing:**
- no observation that the player can name the action while playing;
- no observation that the player can name the action AFTER playing;
- no observation that the player would describe the action differently from the
  observer's description (a "yes I get it" might mean "I read the words" not "I see
  the operation").

**Minimal playtest observation:**
> Mid-session, the observer pauses the player and asks: "right now, what are you
> actually doing? what would happen if you did it badly?" The action recognized
> must be the verb in the genome's `player_actions`. If the player names a different
> action ("I'm picking the smart one"), the action was unclear despite the verbose
> labels.

## Evidence harness for remote players (Phase 18)

For all 8 claims above, the in-product harness at `/playtest/full-cycle` is the **minimum
substrate** for remote evidence collection. A remote run produces:

- a `PlaytestRun` row (mode, started_at, completed_at, final_verdict ∈ {software_only,
  profile_recognition, replay_targeting, transfer_candidate, unclear}, session_ids,
  selected_entry_id);
- one or more `ReflectionEvent` rows per stage ∈ {after_triage, after_game_1,
  after_profile, after_replay, final};
- one `FollowUp24h` row with an unguessable token, a due_at 24h after start, and the 6
  follow-up answers when submitted.

**Backend traces (sessions, moves, interventions) alone are insufficient.** They prove
that the player executed actions; they do NOT prove that the player understood the action,
felt the profile as specific, perceived the replay as targeted, or noticed anything
outside the app. Each unproven claim above maps to harness fields:

| Claim | Harness field |
|---|---|
| C1 — psychotechnical function | `final` reflection + 24h `remembered_operation` |
| C2 — transfer outside app | 24h `outside_app_example` + `appeared_spontaneously` |
| C3 — replay improves the player | `after_replay` reflection ("targeted or just new text?") |
| C4 — draft genome playability | not in this harness — needs separate flow |
| C5 — triage fate quality at scale | `after_triage` reflection |
| C6 — LLM role stability long-form | `after_game_1` reflection ("game-organ, assistant, or noise") |
| C7 — Operator Profile usefulness | `after_profile` reflection ("specific or generic, quote the phrase") |
| C8 — players know their action | `after_game_1` reflection ("what did you think you were doing") |

Remote evidence is COUNTED only when a `PlaytestRun` has:
- reflections at 5 stages (after_triage / after_game_1 / after_profile / after_replay / final),
- `completed_at` set with a final_verdict,
- a 24h `FollowUp24h` row with `completed_at` and at least `transfer_seen` filled.

`/api/playtests/{id}/export` produces a one-file Markdown of the entire run + follow-up.

## Summary

| Claim | Code-side evidence | Smoke evidence | Playtest evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 — psychotechnical function | partial | — | NONE |
| C2 — transfer outside app | partial | — | NONE |
| C3 — replay improves the player | weak | single genre | NONE |
| C4 — draft genomes playable | structural | one chimera cell | NONE |
| C5 — triage fate quality at scale | structural | — | NONE |
| C6 — LLM role stability long-form | mock only | single-turn | NONE |
| C7 — Operator Profile usefulness | structural | — | NONE |
| C8 — players know their action | label-only | — | NONE |

Until at least the first three are addressed by playtest evidence, RC-0 must not be
treated as a finished product. The protocol that addresses every one of these in a single
session is [`docs/playtests/FULL_CYCLE_PLAYTEST_V1.md`](../playtests/FULL_CYCLE_PLAYTEST_V1.md).
